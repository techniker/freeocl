Description of the dispatch table structure.

= Introduction =

The dispatch table is a function table (very similar to a C++ vtable) which is a key component of the ICD driver interface. Each implementation specific object should begin with a pointer to this table which contains the list of all functions implemented by a driver. In order to work this requires the structure to be known in both driver (ie. *libFreeOCL.so*) and client (ie. *libOpenCL.so*) side.


= Details =

The dispatch table is made of chunks of 80 functions ordered by API version. If there is less than 80 functions in a version chunk, the end of the chunk is filled with stub pointers. It seems functions are listed in the same order they appear in *cl.h*.

The structure looks like:
 * functions in OpenCL 1.0 API
 * stubs
 * functions in OpenCL 1.1 API which are not in 1.0 API
 * ...

*NB: this is known to be valid for OpenCL 1.1, it still has to be checked for OpenCL 1.2 functions.*
