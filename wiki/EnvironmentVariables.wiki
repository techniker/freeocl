FreeOCL behavior can be changed using environment variables.

= Environment variables =

== C++ compiler ==

FreeOCL builds OpenCL kernels using a C++ compiler. By default FreeOCL will use the compiler it has been built with but you can override this with the *FREEOCL_CXX_COMPILER* environment variable.

Depending on your compiler you may have to change compiler flags too. This can be done with the *FREEOCL_CXX_FLAGS* environment variable. Beware the compiler must be told to build a shared library and to explicitly parse C++ code. The default flags for GCC are:

_-shared -fPIC -pipe -I./include -g -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -ftree-vectorize -funroll-loops -fno-math-errno -fno-trapping-math -rdynamic -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -x c++ -Wall -Wextra_ (as of r230)
