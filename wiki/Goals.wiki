= Introduction =

FreeOCL's goal is to provide a portable, full-featured and reliable implementation of the Open Computing Language 1.1 specifications targeting CPU devices.
Performance is important but not the top priority.

= Details =

FreeOCL relies on an external C++ compiler to build kernels which means a platform is identifier by its OS, CPU and compiler. Primary goal is to be portable starting with the following major platforms:
  * Linux - x86, x86_64, ARM, PPC64
  * GCC >= 4.4
  * ICC
  * LLVM >= 2.8
  * armcc
