The main goal of FreeOCL is portability, not performance however it's always interesting to see how it compares to other implementations.

This page compares FreeOCL to other OpenCL implementations when running various softwares.

=== ratGPU ===
[http://www.ratgpu.com/ ratGPU] is a raytracer with a built-in benchmark. It allows to compare the performance of all installed OpenCL implementations. There is also a C++ renderer which can be used as a reference for CPU implementations.

The test machine is an Intel Core i7 2700K @ 4.2GHz with an Nvidia GTX 480 GPU running Kubuntu 12.04. Tests were ran with the following implementations:
 * the C++ reference implementation
 * Intel OpenCL 1.1 (Build 31360.31426)
 * FreeOCL/GCC (r173)
 * FreeOCL/Clang (r224)
 * Nvidia OpenCL 1.1 CUDA 4.2.1

The relative rendering times (lower is better) give the following chart:

From left to right: NVidia, C++, FreeOCL/Clang, Intel, FreeOCL/GCC. Not that bad without explicit kernel vectorization ;).
