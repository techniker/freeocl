* optimize math functions (current implementation has been made quickly and most functions are not optimal)
* change threading model (currently FreeOCL may create much more threads than the number of available CPU cores resulting in poor performance)
* implement _rtz, _rtp and _rtn versions of vstore_half
* implement all convert_type(n)(_sat)(_roundingmode) functions
* fix bugs
