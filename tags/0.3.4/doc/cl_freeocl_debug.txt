Number

   TBD

Extension Type

   OpenCL device extension

Dependencies

   OpenCL 1.2 is required

Overview

   This extension adds a compiler option to enable intrusive debugging features
   at runtime such as boundary checks for arrays

Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenCL 1.2 Specification

   In section 5.6, paragraph 5.6.4.3, add:
  "-cl-debug
           This option enables intrusive debugging features at runtime such as
           boundary checks for arrays. This is likely to slow down execution.
           In case of runtime error detection, it won't terminate a thread but
           print a warning message starting with "warning: (%d,%d,%d|%d,%d,%d)"
           where the first 3 integers are the global ids of the thread and 3
           next are its local ids. In case 2 threads encounter an error at the
           same time, it is not valid to have the error messages intermixed."
