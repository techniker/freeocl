---------------------------- FreeOCL ----------------------------

FreeOCL ships with a set of headers required to build kernels and
a copy of OpenCL headers to build and link programs to libOpenCL.

You need cmake >= 2.6 in order to build FreeOCL. SDL is required
to build FreeOCL demos (disabled by default). libatomic-ops is
required at runtime by libFreeOCL.so (if you only want libOpenCL
or don't need to build kernels from source then you don't need
libatomic-ops).

To build FreeOCL, run "make" from FreeOCL root directory. You can
change build options with "make reconfigure" or using cmake tools
in the "build" directory.

The "icd" directory contains the icd file required by libOpenCL
to detect FreeOCL at runtime. This file should be put in:
/etc/OpenCL/vendors/ and have read permission.

When using "make install" or an autogenerated package, all files
should by installed properly (including FreeOCL headers and icd).
If you want to run FreeOCL without installing it you must copy
the icd file to /etc/OpenCL/vendors/ and make sure FreeOCL lib
can be found by ld (alternatively you can edit the icd file and
give an absolute path to libFreeOCL.so). FreeOCL headers must be
in a compiler default path otherwise they won't be found when
building kernels.
